# live-iso-remaster
A couple of simple scripts to chroot into and modify the contents of a(n Ubuntu-derived) live USB iso, to add/remove packages, customize/reskin, etc.

This is not ready for use! Consider it a pre-alpha at best. It makes terrible assumptions, like the size of your USB stick is exactly the same as mine, and that your machine has 16 GB of RAM, and that you hate the same exact packages that I do, etc.
